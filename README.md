## Low Rank Approximation Algorithms
This is a repo about algorithms pertaining to low rank approxmation of matirces. We provide algorithms for singular value decomposition, randomized singular value decomposition, strong rank revealing qr decomposition and adaptive cross approximation. Algorithms are also compared regarding their runtime and errors. Detalied explanation of underlying math is provided in the project report pdf.
